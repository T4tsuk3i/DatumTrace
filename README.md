# 🛰️ DatumTrace

> **Modular OSINT Recon System for Emails, Usernames, and Social Metadata**  
> CLI-based. Configurable. Clean Output. Zero bloat. Built for hackers, researchers, and cyber forensics.

---

## ⚡ Overview

**DatumTrace** is a Linux-first, multi-language OSINT data scraper that extracts:
- 📧 Email addresses from public sources (search engines, code dumps, paste sites)
- 🙍‍♂️ Usernames and social profile traces across platforms
- 🌐 Domain metadata (WHOIS and DNS) via terminal scripts

Designed as a **research-first recon system**, each component is modular and published as an **experiment** — not bundled bloatware.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Email & username scraping via search engine footprints  
- ✅ Modular config with YAML-based source toggling  
- ✅ Platform-aware username verification (GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)  
- ✅ Shell scripts for WHOIS and DNS enumeration  
- ✅ Regex-driven experiments for testing extraction logic  
- ✅ No GUI – pure CLI utility, easily pipeable in scripts

## 💡 Naming Philosophy

> **DatumTrace** = “The subtle, often overlooked trail of publicly exposed data”

This is not a “tool” — it’s a recon research framework that encourages experimentation, trace analysis, and composable intelligence gathering.

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap / TODO

* [ ] Add high-speed Rust-powered scraper
* [ ] Add Shodan / Hunter.io API integrations
* [ ] Export JSON/CSV logs
* [ ] Memory-efficient streaming search
* [ ] Add SOCKS5/Tor support
