**DatumTrace** is a modular, terminal-based **OSINT data scraping framework** that pulls emails, usernames, and social profiles from public sources based on a given **name or domain**.

Designed for privacy researchers, threat hunters, and data investigators — **not a release tool**, but a clean, extendable backend with each module usable as a standalone experiment.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🕵️ Extracts emails, usernames, and social media profiles from various open web sources.
- 📦 Modular Python + YAML structure for easy expansion.
- 🌐 Cross-language design — uses Python, YAML, Bash (and future plugin options).
- ⚙️ CLI interface only — zero GUI clutter.
- 🧪 Each module is cleanly separable for publishing as standalone “experiments”.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> DatumTrace is **not** a one-click OSINT tool.
> It is a **clean, teachable, extensible backend framework**.

* Each module is minimal, self-contained, and reusable.
* Promotes learning through experimentation.
* Ideal for building out your own plugins or pipelines.
